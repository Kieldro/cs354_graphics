CS 354: Computer Graphics 
Project 1: Rendering 3D Objects Using OpenGL and GLUT 
 
commands:	make
 
remarks:
UTF byte order mark <feff> caused a delay with installing glut. :set list in vim to view it
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev  // to install glut

questions:
-include folder?
- extern?

performance tests:
CUBE_GLUT - wire  - 17.92 s   
CUBE_GLUT - solid - 17.92 s      
CUBE_QUAD       - 17.92 s
CUBE_QUAD_ARRAYS = - 17.93 s
CONE_GLUT - wire  = - 17.92 s
CONE_GLUT - solid = - 17.93 s
CONE_TRI        = - 17.92 s
CONE_TRI_ARRAYS = - 17.93 s
CONE_TRI_CALC       = - 17.92 s

All modes ran at the same speed. There seems to be no significant performance differences between implementations. Thus, glut functions will allow for more concise and readable code.
