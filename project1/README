Project 1: Rendering 3D Objects Using OpenGL and GLUT 
 
commands:	make
 
remarks:
UTF byte order mark <feff> caused a delay with installing glut. :set list in vim to view it
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev  // to install glut

questions:
-glutKeyboardFunc(myKeyHandler); // is this a first class function?
-include folder?
- UNAME := $(shell uname) // where is shell defined?
